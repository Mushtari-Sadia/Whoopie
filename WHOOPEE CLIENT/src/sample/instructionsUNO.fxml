Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.&#10;&#10;You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action. For instance, if the Discard Pile has a red card that is an 8 you have to place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it. You can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).&#10;&#10;If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match, they must draw a card from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, the game moves on to the next person in turn. You can also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn.&#10;&#10;Note: If the first card turned up from the Draw Pile (to form the Discard Pile) is an Action card, the Action from that card applies and must be carried out by the first player to go (as stated, it is usually the player to the dealer’s left). The exceptions are if a Wild or Wild Draw Four card is turned up.&#10;&#10;If it is a Wild card, Mattel has now stated that the first player to start (usually the one on the dealer’s left), can choose whatever color to begin play. If the first card is a Wild Draw Four card – Return it to the Draw Pile, shuffle the deck, and turn over a new card. At any time, if the Draw Pile becomes depleted and no one has yet won the round, take the Discard Pile, shuffle it, and turn it over to regenerate a new Draw Pile.&#10;&#10;There are two different ways to play regarding drawing new cards. The Official Uno Rules states that after a card is drawn the player can discard it if it is a match, or if not, play passes on to the next player. The other type is where players continue to draw cards until they have a match, even if it is 10 times.&#10;&#10;The game continues until a player has one card left. The moment a player has just one card they must yell “UNO!”. If they are caught not saying “Uno” by another player before the next player has taken their turn, that player must draw two new cards as a penalty. Assuming that the player is unable to play/discard their last card and needs to draw, but after drawing, is then able to play/discard that penultimate card, the player has to repeat the action of calling out “Uno”. The bottom line is – Announcing “Uno” needs to be repeated every time you are left with one card.&#10;&#10;Once a player has no cards remaining, the game round is over, points are scored, and the game begins over again. Normally, everyone tries to be the first one to achieve 500 points, but you can also choose whatever points number to win the game, as long as everyone agrees to it.&#10;&#10;Action Cards: Besides the number cards, there are several other cards that help mix up the game. These are called Action or Symbol cards.&#10;&#10;Reverse – If going clockwise, switch to counterclockwise or vice versa.&#10;Skip – When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their turn. If turned up at the beginning, the first player loses his/her turn.&#10;Draw Two – When a person places this card, the next player will have to pick up two cards and forfeit his/her turn.&#10;Wild – This card represents all four colors, and can be placed on any card. The player has to state which color it will represent for the next player. It can be played regardless of whether another card is available.&#10;Wild Draw Four – This acts just like the wild card except that the next player also has to draw four cards as well as forfeit his/her turn. With this card, you must have no other alternative cards to play that matches the color of the card previously played. If you play this card illegally, you may be challenged by the other player to show your hand to him/her. If guilty, you need to draw 4 cards. If not, the challenger needs to draw 6 cards instead.&#10;In recent years, Mattel has introduced two new Action card types to Uno. Instead of 108 cards, Uno now has 112 cards. What do these 4 extra cards do? Note: You can still play classic Uno without them by simply removing them before you start the game.&#10;&#10;Wild Swap Hands Card – This is a powerful card that enables you to swap the cards in your hand with anyone of your choice. Being a Wild card, it has the same attributes, namely, you can choose to either play it or not, at any of your turns, and also choose the color of play. Ideally, you would probably want to swap your cards with the player who has the least number of cards! Being a powerful Action card, only one is provided per deck. If turned up at the beginning of the game, the first player to start gets to choose the color and also swap his hands with another person.&#10;Wild Customizable Card – There are 3 of them provided in any deck, and they are all blank. These are meant for you to write down your own “house rules”. Before the game starts, make sure everyone agrees to the rules and also on how many of the Wild Customizable cards will be used. You can use 1-3 of them per game. These are Wild Cards, so the same rules apply to them – The person who plays them gets to choose the color of play, and if turned up at the start, then the first player chooses the color of play.&#10;&#10;What house rules can you make up? Mattel says it’s up to your imagination, but of course it has to be something everyone agrees with. These blank customizable cards were introduced by Mattel to add a huge dash of unpredictability and extra fun to the game.&#10;&#10;Although the cards are erasable and you can write on them with a pencil, but if you are worried that the cards would wear out quickly, one suggestion is to use a detachable plastic sticker and write on the sticker instead, and then lightly stick it onto the card for the duration of the game.&#10;&#10;What if your last card is a Wild Swap Hands?&#10;&#10;This scenario may happen from time to time. If your last card is a Wild Swap Hands card, you can treat it like a normal Wild card and play it to end the game right there and then – No further action is required. This is because you would obviously not win the game if you were required to swap your hand with another player.&#10;&#10;A few wacky suggestions for customizable house rules (Do make up your own!):&#10;&#10;The next player needs to do 3 sit-ups and if he/she fails or refuses, then draw 3 cards.&#10;The next player must sing a song, failing which, he/she needs to draw 2 cards.&#10;Everyone but you must draw 2 cards immediately.&#10;Everyone must immediately discard their Wild cards. Everyone but you.&#10;Call out the color you want. Then act or play a charade, and the first player who correctly guesses it can discard all the cards of that color that they have in hand at that moment.&#10;Everyone skips a turn, or rather, you take an extra turn.&#10;Scoring: When a player no longer has any cards and the game ends, he/she receives points. All opponents’ cards are given to the winner and points are counted. All number cards are the same value as the number on the card (e.g. a 9 is 9 points). “Draw Two&quot; – 20 Points, “Reverse&quot; – 20 Points, “Skip&quot; – 20 Points, “Wild&quot; – 50 Points, and “Wild Draw Four&quot; – 50 Points. “Wild Swap Hands” – 40 Points, “Wild Customizable card” – 40 Points. The first player to attain 500 points wins the game.">
